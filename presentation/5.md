# Where I failed:

## I have not planned out the project well enough before actually starting to code.  
## Product creation allows to use wrong data types to be input and crash the app. App does not allow overwriting with the wrong data type - I do not know why.  
## I originally planned for the stock class
## I added a type object, which could have been a variable of a product.
