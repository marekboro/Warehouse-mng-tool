# Things I managed to figure out:

- [x] Inventory tracks individual <code>products</code> including their:
- name, type and brand
- description, warranty length
- stock quantity
- buying cost, selling price and markup

- [x] <code>Brand</code>s info like name, warranty details and description are tracked.
- [x] <code>Brand</code>s,<code>product</code>s and <code>product</code>s can be edited seperately:
- [x] <code>Brand</code>s,<code>product</code>s and <code>product</code>s can be created seperately:
- [x] I have an inventory page that lists all details for all products
- - I have added a stock model that takes in all the information from products, adding a stock quantity and a basket quantity for updating stock. 
- [x] Visually highlight LOW stock as well as OUT OF STOCK.
- - ising IF in HTML

## EXTENSIONS:
- [x] Added a basket feature that allows me to restock the products.
- - basket can be updated via the main page while orders are processed via the basket interface.
